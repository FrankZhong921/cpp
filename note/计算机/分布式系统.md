### In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm

#### Section 1  Introduction

　　Raft is a consensus algorithm for **managing a replicated log.** 

(简单讲：Raft一致性算法保证replicated log的一致性，使得服务器集群使用相同replicated state machines即状态机加载log得到相同的输出)

​        Paxos is quite difficult to understand. In order to **enhance understandability**, Raft separates the key elements of consensus, such as **leader election**, **log replication**, and **safety**, and it enforcesa stronger degree of coherency to reduce the number of states that must be considered.

(简单讲：Paxos太难啃 *(Section 3描述有多麻烦)*，重新开发个容易理解的一致性算法，强调understandability)

​        Raft is similar in many ways to existing consensus algorithm( most notably, ***Oki and Liskov's Viewstamped Replication***), but it has several novel features:

- **Strong leader:** For example , log entries only flow from leader to other servers.
- **Leader  election**: Raft uses randomized timers to elect leaders. 
- **Membership changes**: allows the cluster to continue operating normally during configuration changes.

#### Section 2  Replicated state machines

​     Replicated state machines are used to **solve a variety of fault to tolerance problems** in distributed systems.  For example, large-scale systems that have a single cluster leader, such as *GFS*,*HDFS* and *RAMCloud*, typically use a separate replicates state machines to manage leader election and store configuration information that must survice leader crashes.  Examples of replicated state machines include Chubby and ZooKeeper.

​     Consensus algorithms for practical systems typically have the following properites:

1. They ensure safety (never returning an incorrect result) under all non-Byzantine conditions, including network delays, partitions, and packet loss, deplication, and reordering.

   （简单讲：一致性算法确保在**非拜占庭条件**时安全）

2. They are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients. Thus, a typical cluster of five servers can tolerate the failure of any two servers. Servers are assumed to fail by stopping; They may later recover from state on stable storage and rejoin the cluster.

   （简单讲：五个服务器的集群可以容忍任意两个服务器失败，并且他们可以重新恢复状态并加入集群）

3. They do not depend on timing to ensure the consistency of the logs: faulty clocks and extreme message delays can, at worst, cause availability problems.

   （简单讲：不依赖计时来保证*logs*的一致性）

   4. In the common case, a command can complete as soon as a majority of the cluster has responded to a single round of remote procedure calls; a minority of slow servers need not impact overall system performance.

      （简单讲：通常情况下，集群的大多数服务器回回应远程系统调用，小部分较慢的服务器不会影响系统的综合表现）
